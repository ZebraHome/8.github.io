title: "Wii: Dynamic budget reallocation in index tuning"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose "Wii," a lightweight mechanism that aims to avoid such spurious what-if calls. It can be seamlessly integrated with existing configuration enumeration algorithms. Experimental evaluation on top of both standard industrial benchmarks and real workloads demonstrates that Wii can eliminate significant number of spurious what-if calls.'
